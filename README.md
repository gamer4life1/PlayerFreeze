# PlayerFreeze
Plugin for Minecraft servers running Spigot that can freeze players in place.

I created this thing a very long time ago for a particular private server I was in charge of administrating.
I figured I might as well put it up on GitHub in case anyone else is interested in using it, modifying it, or learning from its source.

## License
It's MIT license like all my other stuff so just do what you want with it or its parts but leave my name or some attribution on there.
