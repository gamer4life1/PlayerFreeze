# PlayerFreeze
Plugin for Minecraft servers running Spigot that can freeze players in place.

I created this thing a very long time ago for a particular private server I was in charge of administrating.
I figured I might as well put it up on GitHub in case anyone else is interested in using it, modifying it, or learning from its source.

## Usage
Usage is pretty simple, install the plugin then do `/freeze` to freeze someone, `/unfreeze` to unfreeze them. See [plugin.yml](https://github.com/evan3334/PlayerFreeze/blob/master/src/main/resources/plugin.yml) for complete commands, usage, and permissions.

## Installation
Download the .jar file from the [Releases](https://github.com/evan3334/PlayerFreeze/releases) section and place it in your plugins folder. Restart the server and it should be ready to use.

## License
It's MIT license like all my other stuff so just do what you want with it or its parts but leave my name or some attribution on there.

## Support
I made this thing a long time ago so I probably won't be updating it that much, however if you find a critical bug with it I'll probably fix that, just [create an issue](https://github.com/evan3334/PlayerFreeze/issues/new). If you'd like to add features or functionality, please fork the repository.
